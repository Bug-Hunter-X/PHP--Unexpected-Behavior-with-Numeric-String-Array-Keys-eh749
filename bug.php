In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with arrays and their keys.  Consider this scenario: you intend to check if a specific key exists within an array before accessing its value.  You might use `isset()` or `array_key_exists()`, but these functions can behave unexpectedly with keys that have a numeric string representation.

For example:

```php
$myArray = ['1' => 'value'];

if (isset($myArray[1])) {
    echo $myArray[1]; // This will NOT output 'value'
} else {
    echo 'Key does not exist';
}
```

The `isset()` check will return `false` because the key is a string ('1'), while the access uses an integer (1).  Similarly, `array_key_exists()` with a numeric value will also fail to find the key when the key is stored as a string.

This difference between string and integer keys can lead to unexpected results, especially when handling data received from external sources where the key type might be ambiguous.
